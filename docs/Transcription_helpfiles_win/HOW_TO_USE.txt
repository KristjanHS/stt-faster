AUDIO TRANSCRIPTION - HOW TO USE
========================================

QUICK START:
1. Drop audio files into this folder (C:\Users\PC\Downloads\transcribe\)
2. Double-click "transcribe.bat"
3. Wait for processing to complete
4. Find transcripts in the "processed" folder

========================================

BATCH FILES:
------------

📁 transcribe.bat (RECOMMENDED)
   - Processes all audio files with DISTIL preset (balanced speed/accuracy)
   - Creates JSON transcripts with timestamps
   - Moves completed files to "processed" folder
   - Moves failed files to "failed" folder

🚀 transcribe_accurate.bat
   - Same as above but uses LARGE preset (best accuracy, slower)
   - Use for important transcriptions requiring highest quality

📊 check_status.bat
   - Shows summary of all processed files
   - Displays counts: pending, completed, failed

========================================

SUPPORTED FORMATS:
-----------------
✓ .wav
✓ .mp3
✓ .m4a
✓ .flac
✓ .ogg

========================================

OUTPUT:
-------
Each audio file generates a .json file with:
- Full transcript text
- Individual segments with timestamps
- Detected language
- Language probability

Example: "audio.m4a" → "audio.json"

========================================

FOLDERS CREATED:
---------------
📂 processed/  - Successfully transcribed files + JSON outputs
📂 failed/     - Files that failed processing

========================================

NOTES:
------
- Processing is automatic and safe to run multiple times
- File location determines status:
  * Files in main folder → will be processed
  * Files in "processed" folder → already done
  * Files in "failed" folder → previously failed
- Want to reprocess with different preset? Just move the file back!
- Processing time: ~2 seconds per minute of audio (40min audio = ~80sec)

========================================

TROUBLESHOOTING:
---------------
If transcribe.bat doesn't work:
1. Make sure WSL2 is running
2. Check that the Python environment exists
3. Run check_status.bat to see database state

For help, contact the system administrator.
