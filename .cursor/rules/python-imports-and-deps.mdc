- If a `ModuleNotFoundError` is encountered, first verify that the project has been installed in editable mode with `pip install -e .`. The `backend` module and other local packages are made available through this installation. For more details on the project's import strategy, refer to `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`.
- Prefer defining dev/test dependencies in `pyproject.toml` under `[project.optional-dependencies]`, and keep `requirements-dev.txt` as a thin wrapper pointing to extras (e.g., `-e .[test,docs,cli]`). Avoid duplicating pins between extras and requirements files.
