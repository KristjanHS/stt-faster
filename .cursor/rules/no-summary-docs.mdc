- **Never** create or update summary, overview, or completion documents at the end of tasks
- **Never** proactively create files like `TASK_SUMMARY.md`, `COMPLETION_REPORT.md`, `WORK_SUMMARY.md`, etc.
- **Never** update existing documents just to add a summary section or update progress
- **Instead**: Provide a very concise summary (3-5 bullet points max) directly in the chat window
- Keep chat summaries brief: what was done, what changed, what's the result
- Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the user
- This applies to all task completions, series of tasks, and debugging sessions
