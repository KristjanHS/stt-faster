- **MANDATORY**: After any Python code changes, run `make pre-commit` then `make unit` then `make integration` then `make e2e` before considering the task done.
- On failures: Fix issues and re-run until both pass. Do not skip these validation steps.
- Avoid using `print` (Ruff rule T201). Prefer `logging` for application and tests.
