- Write unit tests for your functions and components.
- Run tests using `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/unit/` for unit tests only.
- Use folder-based test suites (see `pyproject.toml` testpaths):
  - Unit: `tests/unit/` (fast, sockets blocked, parallel: `-n auto`)
  - Integration: `tests/integration/` (one real component, network allowed)
  - E2E: `tests/e2e/` (full stack via Docker Compose)
  - UI: `tests/ui/` (Playwright browser tests, `--no-cov`)
- Unit tests must not perform real network I/O. Use integration and e2etests for network operations.
