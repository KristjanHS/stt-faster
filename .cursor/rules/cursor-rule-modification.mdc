- **Always examine existing `.mdc` files in `.cursor/rules/` directory for examples of correct header format before creating or modifying cursor rules**
- Cursor rule headers must follow this exact format:
  ```yaml
  ---
  description: "Brief description of the rule's purpose"
  type: agent-select
  globs: []  # or specific file patterns if applicable
  alwaysApply: true  # or false depending on scope
  ---
  ```
- After the header, content should be a bulleted list of specific guidelines or rules
- When creating new rules, copy the header structure from an existing similar rule and modify as needed
- Verify the YAML syntax is valid and properly indented
