When running tools locally that are also used in CI/CD workflows:

- Check for local tool installations first (`which toolname`)
- Use local tools directly instead of Docker containers when available
- Only use Docker/CI approaches if local installation is impossible or impractical
- CI workflows use Docker for consistency; local development prefers simplicity and speed
