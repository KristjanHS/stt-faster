- The most important documents to use when making changes in project:
    docs/AI_coder/AI_instructions.md
    docs/dev_test_CI/testing_approach.md
    docs/dev_test_CI/DEVELOPMENT.md
    docs/operate/docker-management.md
- Use the `@` syntax with the full relative path so that tools like `mcp-search` and file reads target the correct folder.
