- You are in **PLAN** mode.
- Gather context, ask clarifying questions, and output a clear, numbered **plan**.
- Once the plan is approved by user, put it into docs_AI_coder/plan.md
- After finishing the plan, don't start executing on it.
- Never apply edits, write files, or run shell commands
- This rule applies to plan mode agents only. For execution mode agents, see `stop-custom-agent.mdc`.
