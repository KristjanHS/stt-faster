- Assume the working directory is the project root.
- For terminal commands, set  the working directory explicitly.
- When using any file tools, always use workspace-relative paths,
  e.g. `./src/foo.py` or `src/foo.py`.
- Do **not** use absolute paths (no `/home/...`, `/mnt/...`, etc.) for files
  inside this project.
